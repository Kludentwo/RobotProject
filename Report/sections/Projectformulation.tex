\section{Project formulation}
This project will entail applying knowledge from the theory chapter to handle the kidnapped robot problem. The robot that is to be used is explained in the hardware and platform section. The knowledge chosen for this project can be seen as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Localisation $\rightarrow$ Particle filter
\item Planning $\rightarrow$ A\*
\item Driving $\rightarrow$ PID
\end{itemize}
To properly test the implementation of these subjects, an arena will be set up with a target location and an unknown starting location. It is up to the robot to find its way home to the target location.
