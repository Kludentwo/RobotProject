\section{Project formulation}
This project will entail applying knowledge from the theory chapter to handle the kidnapped robot problem. The robot that is to be used is explained in the robot platform section.\\
Some areas of the theory is needed in order to solve the kidnapped robot problem. 
These areas are localisation, path planning and movement. \\
Localisation is needed in order for the robot to locate itself within a know environment. The goal is to solve the localisation problem with a particle filter.\\
Path planning is important for the robot to be able to get to the set goal after knowing its position. The path planning problem will be solved using A\text{*}.\\
The movement will entail smoothing the path from the planner and implementing PID control to move the robot to the goal while avoiding the obstacles.\\
To properly test the implementation of these subjects, an arena will be set up with a target location and an unknown starting location. It is up to the robot to find its way home to the target location.
