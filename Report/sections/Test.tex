\section{Test}
The test setup is an arena with the dimensions 113 x 141 cm as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:testsetup}. The arena is divided into grid cells of 1x1 cm. An obsticle is placed in the middle of the arena to create a unique situation. This enables the robot to locate itself and drive towards a set goal. The map can be seen in figure \ref{fig:map}.
