\section{Design \& Implementation}
The system is created as a simple robot that can receive move instructions, and take measurements. The move instructions come from a PC running MATLAB. By receiving the measurement data the MATLAB application calculates the best movement action, and send it to the robot. 

The overall system design can be seen in figure \ref{fig:OSD}. The connection between the Computer and the Bluetooth shield is wireless. The connection between the Bluetooth shield and the Arduino Uno is serial. The connection between the Arduino Uno and LIDAR Sensor is serial and lastly the connection between the Arduino Robot and the Arduino Uno is i2c.

Each block in the system will now be discussed in greater detail. 

\subsubsection{Bluetooth shield}
The Bluetooth shield is an "ITEAD Wireless Bluetooth Shield Module Starter Kit For Arduino"\cite{BTshield}\cite{BTshield2}. The responsibility of the Bluetooth shield is to transfer data from the Arduino Uno to the Computer. The shield uses a HC-05 Serial Bluetooth module. Connecting to the shield is done by finding "H-C-2010-06-01" on the Computer and using the password: "1234". The settings for the serial bus is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Default baud rate: 9600
\item Data bits: 8
\item Stop bit: 1
\item No parity
\end{itemize}

This means that the Bluetooth connection can be seen as a simple uart connection between the robot and the computer. 

\subsubsection{LIDAR Sensor}
A LIDAR measurement consists of 90 packets with four range measurements in each. The packet length is 22 bytes and is organised as follows\cite{LIDAR}:
\begin{verbatim}
<start> <index> <speed_L> <speed_H> [Data 0] [Data 1] [Data 2] [Data 3]
 <checksum_L> <checksum_H>
\end{verbatim}
The $start$ code is 0xFA, $index$ goes from 0xA0 to 0xF9, $speed$ is the fixed point speed in RPM and $Data$ $N$ is the Nth reading. Each reading is four bytes in length and contains information about distance, signal strength and two flags. The data is comprised as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
<distance 7:0>  <"invalid data" flag> <"strength warning" flag> 
<distance 13:8> <signal strength 7:0> <signal strength 15:8>
\end{verbatim}
The LIDAR, also called Neato LIDAR can be seen in figure \ref{fig:NeatoLidar}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{billeder/NeatoLidar}
\caption{Neato LIDAR Sensor}
\label{fig:NeatoLidar}
\end{figure}
The LIDAR has four connects to the sensor part and two to the motor part. The motor connects are 3.3 Volt based with red being power and black being ground. The pinout for the sensor part is seen in table \ref{tab:lidars}.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Red & 3.3V \\ \hline
Brown & LDS\_RX \\ \hline
Orange & LDS\_TX \\ \hline
Black & GND \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{LIDAR Sensor Pinout}
\label{tab:lidars}
\end{table}

The motor is a simple DC-motor. But for a correct operation the Neato LIDAR must spin with more than 180 RPM and less than 350 RPM. The group found that a spin speed around 310 RPM gave the optimal sensor readings. This can be regulated using the speed information in the LIDAR data packets. The value in the speed bytes is formatted as RPM*64. So in order to get the RPM one must simply divide the value by 64. The group attained the optimal rotation speed, by regulating a PWM signal, on the motor. 

\subsubsection{Arduino Uno}
The Arduino Uno\cite{ArduinoUno} handles communication with the LIDAR Sensor and the Bluetooth shield.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{billeder/ArduinoUno}
\caption{Arduino Uno}
\label{fig:ArduinoUno}
\end{figure}

The LIDAR data is streamed to the Arduino Uno contentiously with a baud rate on 115200. Therefore is the only hardware UART used to handle this. The data is stored in a internal array for later retrieval.

Since there is only one hardware UART on the Arduino Uno, and both the LIDAR and the bluetooth shield needs one, a software serial port is created to handle the bluetooth communication. 

The Arduino Uno is listening for commands, on the bluetooth connection. A command is formatted as follows: 
\begin{verbatim}
		<command ID 1> <command ID 2> [Command parameters ] < 0x0A ('\n') >
\end{verbatim}

The following commands is handled by the Arduino Uno: 

\begin{tabbing}	
LID \= AR:\\
\>{Command1: [LD D/S/P/E]} \\

\end{tabbing}	

  

\subsubsection{Arduino Robot}
The robot platform used in this project is a Arduino robot\cite{ArduinoRobot}. The Arduino robot platform handles all movement commands.
