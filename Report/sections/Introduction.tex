\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this report is researching how to implement AI in Robotics techniques. The knowledge required for this is acquired from the Udacity course "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics"\cite{AIROK}. The book Probabilistic Robots will be used to supplement the knowledge from the Udacity course\cite{thrun2005probabilistic}.

The overall purpose of the course can be described as these points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define and explain concepts, methods and technologies relating to the chosen subject area.
\item Give an account of research articles relevant to the subject area.
\item Account for the status and application of the subject area.
\item Prepare a report and an oral presentation on the subject area.
\end{itemize}

To fulfil these points this report will be split into two parts, theory and project. The theory will seek to provide an insight into the gained theoretically knowledge about artificial intelligence in robots.
The project part will entail the gained knowledge of implementing the theory in a moving robot.
