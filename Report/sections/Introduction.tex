\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this report is researching how to implement AI in Robotics techniques. The knowledge required for this is acquired from the Udacity course "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics"\cite{AIROK}. The book Probabilistic Robotics\cite{thrun2005probabilistic} will be used to supplement the knowledge from the Udacity course.

This report will be split into two parts, theory and project. The theory will seek to provide an insight into the gained theoretically knowledge about artificial intelligence in robots.
The project part will entail the gained knowledge of implementing the theory in a moving robot.
